#   File:  errors.en_US
#
#   Description:
#
#	This file contains localized string object definitions.
#
#	Locale:  en_US ( US English )
#
#	Domain:  Errors
#
#   Rules:
#
#	[1] Uniqueness:
#
#	    The combination of locale, domain, string ID, and string
#	    version must uniquely define a string object within the
#	    universe of all string objects.
#
#	[2] Locale
#
#	    Only one locale may be specified in this file.  The locale
#	    definition must be the first non-comment statement.
#
#	[3] Domain
#
#	    There may be multiple domains specified in this file.  The
#	    domain will apply to all string definitions that follow
#	    until the next domain definition statement appears.
#
#	[4] String Format:
#
#	    Within this file all strings must be delimited by an opening
#	    and closing double-quote character.  The quotes will not be
#	    part of the string stored in the database.  A double-quote
#	    character can be an element of the string if it is escaped
#	    with a backslash, for example "Delete \"unneeded\" files."
#	    will be stored as "Delete "unneeded" files.".
#
#	    Substitution parameters can be specified with %i, where i is
#	    an integer from 0 to 99.  The percent character can be an
#	    element of the string if it is escaped with a backslash, for
#	    example "It is 100\% good.".  Here is an example of an error
#	    string that specifies one substitution parameter:
#
#				File %0 not found.
#
#	    If the substitution string is "pin.conf" the formatted
#	    string will be "File pin.conf not found.".
#
#	    The STRING and optional HELPSTR are localizable.  This file must be 
#	    in UTF-8 encoding. The LOCALE and DOMAIN strings are assumed
#	    to be ASCII (no extended-ASCII characters nor multiple byte 
#	    characters are allowed).
#
#	[5] String ID:
#
#	    A string ID must be unique within a domain.
#
#	[6] String Version:
#
#	    Each string has an individual version, typically starting
#	    from 1, that the string owner assigns.

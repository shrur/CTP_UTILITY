# Syntax:
#   <event> : <rum_name> : <TOD_mode> : <timezone> : <min_quantity> \ 
#   : <min_unit> : <incr_quantity> : <incr_unit> : <rounding_mode> \
#   : <rate_plan_name>
# 
# Parameters:
#    <event>
#      The event type to which this ratable usage metric (RUM) 
#      will apply.
#
#    <rum_name>
#      The name of the RUM.  This is the name you will choose in the 
#      Pricing Tool when you create products.
#    
#    <TOD_mode>
#      How time-of-day rates are applied to this event. 
#      Valid values are:
#
#          Start time - Specify "START_TIME" or "0" to indicate the 
#                       rate should use the start time of the event.
#          End time - Specify "END_TIME" or "1" to indicate the rate 
#                     should use the end time of the event. 
#          Timed - Specify "TIMED" or "2" indicates the rate should 
#                  use the duration of the event.
#
#    <timezone>
#       This parameter is reserved for future use. Leave this value 
#       set to "0". 
#
#    <min_quantity>
#       The minimum value the RUM quantity is rounded to. This value
#       is used with the min_unit parameter.  For example, if you 
#       charge $1/hour and you want to charge for at least an hour
#       regardless of how long a session lasts, specify a 
#       min_quantity value of "1" and a min_unit value of "HOUR".
#
#    <min_unit>  
#       The unit in which the min_quantity value is specified. Valid
#       values are:
#         None - Specify "NONE" or "0" to indicate there is no unit 
#                associated with the min_quantity value.
#         Seconds - Specify "SECOND" or "1" to indicate the 
#                   min_quantity is expressed in terms of seconds. 
#         Minutes - Specify "MINUTE" or "2" to indicate the 
#                   min_quantity is expressed in terms of minutes.
#         Hours - Specify "HOUR" or "3" to indicate the 
#                 min_quantity is expressed in terms of hours.
#         Days - Specify "DAY" or "4" to indicate the min_quantity 
#                is expressed in terms of days.
#
#    <incr_quantity>
#       The quantity by which the RUM quantity is changed during 
#       rating. This value is used with the incr_unit.
#       For example, if you charge $1/hour and you want to charge 
#       for 6-minute increments, specify an incr_quantity value
#       of "6" and incr_unit value of "MINUTE".
#
#    <incr_unit>
#       The unit in which the incr_quantity value is specified. Valid
#       values are:    
#         None - Specify "NONE" or "0" to indicate there is no unit 
#                associated with the incr_quantity value.
#         Seconds - Specify "SECOND" or "1" to indicate the 
#                   incr_quantity is expressed in terms of seconds. 
#         Minutes - Specify "MINUTE" or "2" to indicate the 
#                   incr_quantity is expressed in terms of minutes.
#         Hours - Specify "HOUR" or "3" to indicate the 
#                 incr_quantity is expressed in terms of hours.
#         Days - Specify "DAY" or "4" to indicate the incr_quantity
#                is expressed in terms of days.
#
#    <rounding_mode>
#       Indicates how the RUM quantity is rounded. Valid values are:
#         Nearest - Specify "NEAREST" or "0" to indicate rounding should 
#                   be to the nearest valid value. 
#         Up - Specify "UP" or "1" to indicate rounding should be to 
#              the nearest valid value greater than the RUM quantity.
#         Down - Specify "DOWN" or "2" to indicate rounding should be 
#                to the nearest valid value less than the RUM quantity
#
#    <rate_plan_name>
#      Indicates which rate plan name to use.

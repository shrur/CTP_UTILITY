#   File:  era_descr.en_US
#
#   Description:
#
#	This file contains localized string object definitions.
#
#	Locale:  en_US ( US English )
#
#	Domain:  era_descr (version = 1)
#
#   Rules:
#
#	[1] Uniqueness:
#
#	    The combination of locale, domain, string ID, and string
#	    version must uniquely define a string object within the
#	    universe of all string objects.
#	    
#	    NOTE:
#	    =====
#	    This uniqueness must be ensured while creating or updating
#	    this ERA name, description file. If there are duplicate entries,
#	    the programs behaviour depends on the option used. If the
#	    -f option is used then the last duplicate string definition
#	    will overwrite any previous ones. If the -f option is not
#	    used then, duplicate string definitions will be rejected.
#
#	[2] Locale
#
#	    Only one locale may be specified in this file.  The locale
#	    definition must be the first non-comment statement.
#
#	[3] Domain
#
#	    There may be multiple domains specified in this file.  The
#	    domain will apply to all string definitions that follow
#	    until the next domain definition statement appears.
#
#	[4] String Format:
#
#	    Within this file all strings must be delimited by an opening
#	    and closing double-quote character and should be limited to
#	    1023 characters.  The quotes will not be part of the string 
#	    stored in the database.  A double-quote character can be an 
#	    element of the string if it is escaped with a backslash, for 
#	    example "Delete \"unneeded\" files." will be stored as 
#	    "Delete "unneeded" files.".
#
#	    Substitution parameters can be specified with %i, where i is
#	    an integer from 0 to 99.  The percent character can be an
#	    element of the string if it is escaped with a backslash, for
#	    example "It is 100\% good.".  Here is an example of an error
#	    string that specifies one substitution parameter:
#
#				File %0 not found.
#
#	    If the substitution string is "pin.conf" the formatted
#	    string will be "File pin.conf not found.".
#
#         The STRING and optional HELPSTR are localizable.  This file must
#	    be in UTF-8 encoding. The LOCALE and DOMAIN strings are assumed
#         to be ASCII (no extended-ASCII characters nor multiple byte
#         characters are allowed).
#
#	[5] String ID:
#
#	    A string ID must be unique within a domain.
#	    
#	    NOTES:
#	    =====
#	    This uniqueness must be ensured while creating or updating
#	    this ERA name, description file. Please see the note about 
#	    uniqueness above.
#
#	    The id's and version's chosen in this file should be kept in
#	    sync with the pin_device_state_sim configuration file.
#
#	[6] String Version:
#
#	    Each string has an individual version, typically starting
#	    from 1, that the string owner assigns.

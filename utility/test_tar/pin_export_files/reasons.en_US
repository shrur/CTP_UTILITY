#
#   Rules:
#
#	[1] Uniqueness:
#
#	    The combination of locale, domain, string ID, and string
#	    version must uniquely define a string object within the
#	    universe of all string objects.
#	    
#	    NOTE:
#	    =====
#	    This uniqueness must be ensured while creating or updating
#	    this Reason Codes file. If there are duplicate entries,
#	    the programs behaviour depends on the option used. If the
#	    -f option is used then the last duplicate string definition
#	    will overwrite any previous ones. If the -f option is not
#	    used then, duplicate string definitions will be rejected,
#	    except for the Event-GLID mappings which are always 
#	    overwritten.
#
#	[2] Locale
#
#	    Only one locale may be specified in this file.  The locale
#	    definition must be the first non-comment statement.
#
#	[3] Domain
#
#	    There may be multiple domains specified in this file.  The
#	    domain will apply to all string definitions that follow
#	    until the next domain definition statement appears.
#
#	[4] String Format:
#
#	    Within this file all strings must be delimited by an opening
#	    and closing double-quote character.  The quotes will not be
#	    part of the string stored in the database.  A double-quote
#	    character can be an element of the string if it is escaped
#	    with a backslash, for example "Delete \"unneeded\" files."
#	    will be stored as "Delete "unneeded" files.".
#
#	    Substitution parameters can be specified with %i, where i is
#	    an integer from 0 to 99.  The percent character can be an
#	    element of the string if it is escaped with a backslash, for
#	    example "It is 100\% good.".  Here is an example of an error
#	    string that specifies one substitution parameter:
#
#				File %0 not found.
#
#	    If the substitution string is "pin.conf" the formatted
#	    string will be "File pin.conf not found.".
#
#           The STRING and optional HELPSTR are localizable.  This file must be
#           in UTF-8 encoding. The LOCALE and DOMAIN strings are assumed
#           to be ASCII (no extended-ASCII characters nor multiple byte
#           characters are allowed).
#
#	[5] String ID:
#
#	    A string ID must be unique within a domain.
#	    
#	    NOTE:
#	    =====
#	    This uniqueness must be ensured while creating or updating
#	    this Reason Codes file. Please see the note about 
#	    uniqueness above.
#
#	[6] String Version:
#
#	    For reason codes, this field will be used to specify the
#	    domain that the reason belongs to, for example, Credit or 
#           Debit. The values have been predefined; they must not be 
#	    changed.
#
#	[7] Event to G/L ID mapping:
#
#	    These mappings are specified in this file. 
#
#	    G/L IDs can now be assigned based on Reason Codes. This is
#	    currently applicable for Account level adjustments only.
#
#	    Events associated with specific Debit or Credit reasons are 
#	    listed under the corresponding reason code and they start
#	    with the header "EVENT-GLID" and end with "EVENT-GLID-END".
#
#	    In the earlier releases of Infranet, G/L ID mappings
#	    for pre-rated events could be specified using the 
#	    Policy Configuration tool. Now these mappings must
#	    be specified in this file. A new domain named "Others"
#	    has been created for providing the G/L ID mappings
#	    for these events. 
#   
#	    All the mappings shown are examples and need to be
#	    changed appropriately during setup.

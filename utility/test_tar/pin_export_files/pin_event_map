# Syntax:
# <purchase_level> : <event_type> : <event_description> : <count> : <unit> : <use start_t or end_t>
#
# Parameters:
#
#    <purchase_level>
#      Indicates whether an account or a specific service is 
#      associated with the event types. 
#
#      Valid values are:
#          account - Specifies that all services associated with the
#                    account purchasing the product will be associated
#                    with the set of event types.
#          <service_name> - Specifies that only the service with this
#                           service_name will be associated with the
#                           set of event types.
#    <event_type>
#      Indicates the event type to associate with a particular 
#      purchase level.  You can specify more than one event type
#      per purchase level.
#
#    <event_description>
#      A short description of the event type.  This description is 
#      displayed in the Pricing Tool.
#
#    <count>
#      Optional parameter. It indicates frequency of the event. 
#      Must be positive numbers
#      If left blank, it defaults to 0.
#
#    <unit>
#      Optional parameter. It indicates the unit of the frequency of the cycle event. 
#      Must be these values (month, day, week, year)
#      If left blank, it defaults to month.
#
#    <use start_t or end_t>
#      Optional parameter. This parameter is for session event whose's start_t and end_t are
#	   different typically; since in Apollo we have the validity-based sub-balances, so we need 
#      to know which time point (start_t or end_t) to be used when determining which 
#	   sub-balances are valid for this event.  By default, start_t will be used, you can
#      specify end_t also. If left blank, it defaults to start_t.
#	   This setting is per event type, so for one event type only one value can be specified, 
#	   even though it's possible that the same event type can appear in different purchase
#      levels.
#
#	Count of cycle events must be greater than 0
#	When cache is loaded, count for pre-defined cycle-events like
#	cycle_forward_monthly, cycle_forward_bimonthly,
#	cycle_forward_quarterly, cycle_forward_semiannual and
#	cycle_forward_annual are forced to 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 respectively.

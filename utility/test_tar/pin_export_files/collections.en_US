#   File:  collections.en_US
#
#   Description:
#
#       This file contains localized string object definitions.
#
#       Locale:  en_US ( US English )
#
#       Domain:  collections
#
#   Rules:
#
#       [1] Uniqueness:
#
#           The combination of locale, domain, string ID, and string
#           version must uniquely define a string object within the
#           universe of all string objects.
#           
#           NOTE:
#           =====
#           This uniqueness must be ensured while creating or updating
#           this new Subscriber Preferences file. If there are duplicate entries,
#           the programs behaviour depends on the option used. If the
#           -f option is used then the last duplicate string definition
#           will overwrite any previous ones. If the -f option is not
#           used then, duplicate string definitions will be rejected.
#
#       [2] Locale
#
#           Only one locale may be specified in this file.  The locale
#           definition must be the first non-comment statement.
#
#       [3] Domain
#
#           There may be multiple domains specified in this file.  The
#           domain will apply to all string definitions that follow
#           until the next domain definition statement appears.
#
#       [4] String Format:
#
#           Within this file all strings must be delimited by an opening
#           and closing double-quote character.  The quotes will not be
#           part of the string stored in the database.  A double-quote
#           character can be an element of the string if it is escaped
#           with a backslash, for example "Delete \"unneeded\" files."
#           will be stored as "Delete "unneeded" files.".
#
#           Substitution parameters can be specified with %i, where i is
#           an integer from 0 to 99.  The percent character can be an
#           element of the string if it is escaped with a backslash, for
#           example "It is 100\% good.".  Here is an example of an error
#           string that specifies one substitution parameter:
#
#                               File %0 not found.
#
#           If the substitution string is "pin.conf" the formatted
#           string will be "File pin.conf not found.".
#
#         The STRING and optional HELPSTR are localizable.  This file must
#           be in UTF-8 encoding. The LOCALE and DOMAIN strings are assumed
#         to be ASCII (no extended-ASCII characters nor multiple byte
#         characters are allowed).
#
#       [5] String ID:
#
#           A string ID must be unique within a domain.
#           
#       [6] String Version:
#
#           Each string has an individual version, typically starting
#           from 1, that the string owner assigns.

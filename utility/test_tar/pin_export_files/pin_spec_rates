#	This Portal configuration file 'pin_spec_rates' is being used
# by the rating engine to map the opcode(s) to event type to be rated. 
# This config file will be loaded to create a new config object 
# (/config/spec_rates) by an app called load_pin_spec_rates, which parses 
# this config file and creates an Portal config object.
#
# The format of this file is,
#	OPCODE		OPFLAG		EVENT_TYPE
#	-------------------------------------------
#	302		0		/event/customer
# 
# The OPCODE field indicates the policy opcode that specify the rating 
# information for the event specified in EVENT_TYPE. For example, the 
# policy opcode PCM_OP_ACT_POL_SPEC_RATES will be used to rate the events 
# of the type '/event/customer'.
# Note a event subtype will match the opcode specified for its parent type. 
# However, the rating engine will find the entry that best match the 
# incoming event type.
#
version 1
#
# The following entries of the format
#	opcode	opflag	event-type
#	302	0	/event/customer
#
# This causes PCM_OP_ACT_POL_SPEC_RATES opcode to be called when a
# event of '/event/customer' type or its subtype happens. Vendors can 
# specify special flags to be passed while calling the opcode using the 
# OPFLAG field.

302	0	/event/customer
302	0	/event/session/ipt
